A story based shooter made by a 15 year old student in Unity.

Right now this game is in a very early pre-alpha state but i plan to finish and release it in the 4th quarter of 2022 if everything goes to plan.

The concept of the game is that you are an NSA agent during the cold war and have to prevent an invasion by the russians.
(Just like in WarGames only you're an NSA agent not DavidðŸ˜‰)
